## Possible steps to take
  - Data preparation
    - Exploratory Data Analysis
      - Check packaging
      - Look at top and bottom of dataset
      - Check your Ns
      - Look at center and spread
      - Make comparisons (Correlation between columns?)
    - Data Cleaning
      - ~Missing data?~
      - Noisy data?
      - Handling outliers?
    - Data Transformation
      - Normalizing continuous data
      - Dummy coding categorical data
    - Data reduction
      - Removing irrelevant columns?
  - Model Training
    - Use crossvalidation for multiple train/dev splits
      - How do we divide into train/dev splits?
        - 80/20?
        - Take random samples?
    - Use different models
    - Bias-variance tradeoff
  - Model evaluation
    - Test the accuracy of models
      - Metrics (R2, MSE, RMSE, MAE, mAE)
    - Choose the best performing model
  - Result
    - Use the chosen model to predict result on the test set

## Shared working space
I made a google colab (in R) that we can use:
